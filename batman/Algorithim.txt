Batman:
First line of input contains an integer  the number of test cases.

We approached the binary search.

For each test case:

The first will check block size (10*10)

Figure out initial position (x,y) and ending position(x1,y1)

Move the  steps are (U, R, UR, UL)

initial step UR to first posiotn (x,y) = (0,0) while reached the final position

Get the optimization by (x1+(x2-x1))/2 & (y1 + (y2 - y1)

continue the process untill reach the goal.
